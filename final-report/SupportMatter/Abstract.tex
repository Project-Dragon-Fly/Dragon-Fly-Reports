It have seen large improvements and innovation in the past decades. Almost all of our day-to-day activities are depended on the transport system. Hence there exist the need for safe policing of traffic. Existing method involves large human resource allocated for tedious task of tracking a vehicle. This project proposes an integrated system that make use of existing state-of-the-art technologies to support policing of traffic. The system incorporates the use of AI technologies to mimic the human intelligence for faster processing of tedious task. Major AI technologies mention in this project include YOLOv4 algorithm, DeepSORT tracker and Siamese Network. The system aims for successful re-identification of multiple vehicles across multiple camera viewpoints. The system provides interactive user interface that hides the complexities involved in achieving the task. Various aspects of security are also considered during the development of the project.\vfill\begin{flushright}	\textit{\studentA} \\	\textit{\studentB} \\	\textit{\studentC} \\	\textit{\studentD}\end{flushright}\thispagestyle{plain}%=======================================================================
